      <p>I really liked this website because the site is incredibly interactive. There's many different options and pathways you can click as you explore the website, getting deeper and deeper into the story it's telling. </p>

        <p>I really liked this website because it's incredibly appropriate for the service it's selling. As it says "we help interesting companies do interesting things" the site itself shows that. There are many interesting features, like its automatic continuous scrolling or the characters that fly across the screen at random.</p>

        <p>I really liked this website because it's very visually appealing. As it's for a restaurant, it shows the food and drinks it's selling beautifully and in a creative way. It's also very user friendly, with basic navigation to find the information you need quickly.</p>
