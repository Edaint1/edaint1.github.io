   <img src="images/sites/Week-15.png" alt="Clever Frank- Week 14 website">
   <p>This website, while it displays art, is artwork in itself. There's a SUPER cool feature for the display text at the top of the page. Catches your eye and can make you interact with it for very long time. The site is addicting. </p>

   <p>Actually just the coolest site. I had no idea a website could have these capabilities. It promotes the user to touch and gesture with the features on the screen. Also a really interesting scrolling feature that changes the farther you move down the page.  </p>
